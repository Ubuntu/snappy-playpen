 desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
 Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run

Description-en: GUI to control and monitor the BOINC core client
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing using volunteered computer
 resources.
 .
 This package contains the BOINC Manager, a graphical monitor and
 control utility for the BOINC core client. It gives a detailed
 overview of the state of the client it is monitoring, as there are
  * attached projects
  * running tasks
  * file transfers between the client and project servers
  * statistics about granted credits and disk usage for every project
  * constraints on CPU usage
 The BOINC Manager has two modes of operation, the "Simple View" in which
 it only displays the most important information and the "Advanced View"
 in which all information and all control elements are available.
 .
 For active participation in any BOINC project the recommended
 boinc-client package, not the boinc-manager, is required for every
 machine contributing.

 projects.
 .
 The BOINC client is configurable by the command line or the BOINC
 manager's GUI to compute with any range between 0% and 100% of
 available resources, and to change that ratio to a higher after
 some user determined duration of inactivity. There is now quite
 a number of individuals who prefer to have everything presented
 with their accustomed principle for setting and choosing a screen
 saver. Upon inactivity, the BOINC client is started, and stopped
 again when the user is back. To save the screen, it then shows
 the graphical progress indication as optionally shown also by
 the manager.
 .
 This package is excellent to further promote BOINC, recalling the
 effect SETI@Home once had in the Cambridge, UK, CB2 Cybercafe.
 Just, when using it together with the regular BOINC client setup,
 it is suggested not to have all CPUs used to avoid multiple
 processes running on the same core.

Description-md5: 4eec63ec6a45894436866732b96c2698
Description-en: Fix non-ANSI header files
 FixIncludes was created to fix non-ANSI system header files. Many
 system manufacturers supply proprietary headers that are not ANSI compliant.
 The GNU compilers cannot compile non-ANSI headers. Consequently, the
 FixIncludes shell script was written to fix the header files.

 Not all packages with header files are installed on the system, when the
 package is built, so we make fixincludes available at build time of other
 packages, such that checking tools like lintian can make use of it.

Description-en: C++ representation of time duration, time point, and clocks
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost.Chrono library provides:
 .
  * A means to represent time durations: managed by the generic
 duration class . Examples of time durations include days, minutes,
 seconds and nanoseconds, which can be represented with a fixed number
 of clock ticks per unit. All of these units of time duration are
 united with a generic interface by the duration facility.
  * A type for representing points in time: time_point. A time_point
 represents an epoch plus or minus a duration. The library leaves
 epochs unspecified. A time_point is associated with a clock.
  * Several clocks, some of which may not be available on a
 particular platform: system_clock, steady_clock and
 high_resolution_clock. A clock is a pairing of a time_point and
 duration, and a function which returns a time_point representing now.
 .
 To make the timing facilities more generally useful, Boost.Chrono
 provides a number of clocks that are thin wrappers around the
 operating system's time APIs, thereby allowing the extraction of wall
 clock time, user CPU time, system CPU time spent by the process:
 .
  * process_real_cpu_clock, captures wall clock CPU time spent by the
 current process.
  * process_user_cpu_clock, captures user-CPU time
 spent by the current process.
  * process_system_cpu_clock, captures
 system-CPU time spent by the current process.
  * A tuple-like class
 process_cpu_clock, that captures real, user-CPU, and system-CPU
 process times together.
  * A thread_clock thread steady clock giving
 the time spent by the current thread (when supported by a platform).
 .
 Lastly, Boost.Chrono includes typeof registration for duration and
 time_point to permit using emulated auto with C++03 compilers.

 Boost.Coroutine provides templates for generalized subroutines which
 allow multiple entry points for suspending and resuming execution at
 certain locations. It preserves the local state of execution and
 allows re-entering subroutines more than once (useful if state must

 utilities grep, sed and awk, and the programming language perl, each
 of which make extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++
 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C
 libraries can not do.

 TSM is a state machine for DEC VT100-VT520 compatible terminal
 emulators. It tries to support all common standards while keeping

 TSM itself does not provide any rendering nor window management.
 It is a simple plain state machine without any external dependencies.
 It can be used to implement terminal emulators, but also to implement
 other applications that need to interpret terminal escape sequences.

 This library is very similar to libvte of the gnome project.
 However, libvte is highly bound to GTK+, which makes it unsuitable for
 non-graphics projects that need to parse escape sequences. Instead,
 TSM tries to restrict its API to terminal emulation only. Furthermore,
 TSM does not try to establish a new terminal emulation standard, but
 instead keeps compatibility as close to xterm as possible.

Package: lsb-core
Description-md5: 390d8738603a81a9f136aad6064a4b28
Description-en: Linux Standard Base core support package
 The Linux Standard Base (http://www.linuxbase.org/) is a standard
 core system that third-party applications written for Linux can
 depend upon.
 .
 This package provides an implementation of the core of the Linux Standard
 Base for Debian on the Intel x86, Intel ia64 (Itanium), IBM S390, and
 PowerPC 32-bit architectures with the Linux kernel. Future revisions of the
 specification and this package may support the LSB on additional
 architectures and kernels.
 .
 The intent of this package is to provide a best current practice way
 of installing and running LSB packages on Debian GNU/Linux. Its
 presence does not imply that Debian fully complies
 with the Linux Standard Base, and should not be construed as a
 statement that Debian is LSB-compliant.

Package: lsb-invalid-mta
Description-md5: 33de1113b88f03d989868cbc67ba462c
Description-en: Linux Standard Base sendmail dummy
 The Linux Standard Base (http://www.linuxbase.org/) is a standard
 core system that third-party applications written for Linux can
 depend upon.
 .
 This package contains nothing else than a fake /usr/sbin/sendmail
 command to fulfill the LSB's requirement of providing this command without
 requiring an MTA to get installed, which once introduces a daemon which
 can cause security problems and second, users get asked questions about
 how they want their MTA configured when in reality they simply wanted to
 install a desktop application or a printer driver, but the dependency on
 LSB compliance pulls in an MTA with the installation.
 .
 The LSB requirement on /usr/sbin/sendmail comes from old times where Linux
 and Unix machines had all fixed IPs and did server tasks in data centers.
 Today's typical desktop Linux machines do not do local e-mail any more as
 users use external e-mail services.
 .
 The /usr/sbin/sendmail always exits with exit status -1 (255) and sends a
 warning message to stderr, so that if a program actually tries to send e-mail
 via the sendmail command the user gets note.

 that acts as a proxy to a set of back-end X servers. All of the visible
 rendering is passed to the back-end X servers. Clients connect to the Xdmx
 front-end, and everything appears as it would in a regular multi-head
 configuration. If Xinerama is enabled (e.g., with +xinerama on the command
 line), the clients see a single large screen.

Package: xvfb
Description-md5: ff95e4399e5ec034de6998347673eb73
Description-en: Virtual Framebuffer 'fake' X server
 Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory. The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
 simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
 environment. This convenience script requires the use of the xauth
 program.
 .
 More information about X.Org can be found at:
 <URL:http://www.X.org>

 This package is built from the X.org xserver module.

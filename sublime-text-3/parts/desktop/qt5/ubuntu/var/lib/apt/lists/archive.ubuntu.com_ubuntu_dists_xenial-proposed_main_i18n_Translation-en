Package: bdf2psf
Description-md5: 5eb98031ca1e36678eeeefee0d31085b
Description-en: font converter to generate console fonts from BDF source fonts
 This package provides a command-line converter that can be used in
 scripts to build console fonts from BDF sources automatically. The
 converter comes with a collection of font encodings that cover many
 of the world's languages. The output font can use a different
 character encoding from the input. When the source font does not
 define a glyph for a particular symbol in the encoding table, that
 glyph position in the console font is not wasted but used for another
 symbol.
 .
 When deciding about the position in the font for a particular glyph,
 the converter takes into account that in text video modes the video
 adapter copies the eighth column of the glyph matrix of symbols
 positioned in the pseudographic area to the ninth column. In order to
 create fonts for text video modes, the width of the glyph matrix of
 the source BDF font should be seven, eight, or nine pixels; otherwise the
 converter creates fonts suitable for framebuffer only.

Description-md5: d3fd4372607d45553d46ed1fecfb4f99
Description-en: GRand Unified Bootloader, version 2 (PC/BIOS binaries)
 GRUB is a portable, powerful bootloader.  This version of GRUB is based on a
 cleaner design than its predecessors, and provides the following new features:
 .
  - Scripting in grub.cfg using BASH-like syntax.
  - Support for modern partition maps such as GPT.
  - Modular generation of grub.cfg via update-grub.  Packages providing GRUB
    add-ons can plug in their own script rules and trigger updates by invoking
    update-grub.
  - VESA-based graphical mode with background image support and complete 24-bit
    color set.
  - Support for extended charsets.  Users can write UTF-8 text to their menu
    entries.
 .

 as the active boot loader, nor will it automatically update grub.cfg on
 upgrade, so most people should install grub-pc instead.

Description-en: Linux Standard Base support package
 The Linux Standard Base (http://www.linuxbase.org/) is a standard
 core system that third-party applications written for Linux can
 depend upon.
 .
 This package provides an implementation of only the printing and core
 modules of the Linux Standard Base for Ubuntu.  Recent versions of Ubuntu
 do not implement the full LSB interfaces; this package is provided only for
 compatibility with third-party printer driver packages which depend on the
 lsb package.
 .
 The intent of this package is to provide a best current practice way
 of installing and running LSB packages on Debian GNU/Linux. Its presence
 does not imply that Ubuntu fully complies with the Linux Standard Base,
 and should not be construed as a statement that Ubuntu is LSB-compliant.

 core system that third-party applications written for Linux can

 The lsb-release command is a simple tool to help identify the Linux
 distribution being used and its compliance with the Linux Standard Base.
 LSB conformance will not be reported unless the required metapackages are
 installed.
 .
 While it is intended for use by LSB packages, this command may also
 be useful for programmatically distinguishing between a pure Debian
 installation and derived distributions.

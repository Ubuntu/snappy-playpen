# ubuntukylin-icon-theme-snap snap

This project creates a working snap of the ubuntukylin icon theme.

To get this done, we need to do the following:
 - add new interface to snapd to support icon-themes


## Current state

Working features:
 - everything

Known issues:
  - works only in devmode. An interface for supporting icon-themes (and themes in general) is in discussion: [1582784](https://bugs.launchpad.net/snappy/+bug/1582784)

## Why is it useful
This can be useful to package icon themes in general.

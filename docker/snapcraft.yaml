summary: Docker
description: |
  Docker complements kernel namespacing with a high-level API which operates at
  the process level. It runs unix processes with strong guarantees of isolation
  and repeatability across servers.
  .
  Docker is a great building block for automating distributed systems:
  large-scale web deployments, database clusters, continuous deployment systems,
  private PaaS, service-oriented architectures, etc.
  .
  This package contains the daemon and client. Using docker.io on non-amd64 hosts
  is not supported at this time. Please be careful when using it on anything
  besides amd64.
  .
  Also, note that kernel version 3.8 or above is required for proper operation of
  the daemon process, and that any lower versions may have subtle and/or glaring
  issues.

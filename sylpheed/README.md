# Sylpheed Snap

## Explanation and disclaimer
This project attempts to create a working Sylpheed snap using experimental
Subversion support currently in the process of being merged, but is still
being worked on. If you **need** to build this snap, my **experimental**
code is available in [my Snapcraft fork](https://github.com/tsimonq2/snapcraft), but I **do NOT** recommend it. The
pull request adding this feature is [pull request #567](https://github.com/ubuntu-core/snapcraft/pull/567) in Snapcraft.

## What's Sylpheed?

The official explanation is:

Sylpheed is a simple, lightweight but featureful, and easy-to-use e-mail client.

## Current state of the Snap

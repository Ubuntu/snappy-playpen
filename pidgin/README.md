# Pidgin snap

This creates a Pidgin snap from the Pidgin development Mercurial repository.

Note, they don't recommend use of this bleeding-edge repo, so this would go in an appropriate snappy channel for that.

## Current state

Everything should be working except plugin support, I couldn't get that to compile.
